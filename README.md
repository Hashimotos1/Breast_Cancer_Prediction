Breast Cancer Prediction with Machine Learning

Machine Learning algorithms will be used to predict whether the fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass is benign (B) or malignant (M) usign the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) DataSet.

For each digitized image of the FNA, the following is computed for each cell nucleus:

a) radius (mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter)

b) texture (standard deviation of gray-scale values)

c) perimeter

d) area

e) smoothness (local variation in radius lengths)

f) compactness (perimeter^2 / area - 1.0)

g) concavity (severity of concave portions of the contour)

h) concave points (number of concave portions of the contour)

i) symmetry

j) fractal dimension ("coastline approximation" - 1)

The mean, standard error (SE) and "worst" or largest (mean of the three largest values) of these features were computed for each image, resulting in 30 features. For instance, field 3 is Mean Radius, field 13 is Radius SE, field 23 is Worst Radius.

The data will be analyzed using Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Python, and Jupyter Notebooks.
